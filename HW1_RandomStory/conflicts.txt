On a {Setting.Weather} day, {Actor1.Name}, who {Actor1.Description} and is a {Actor1.Occupation}, was put at odds against the evil {Actor2.Name} at a {Setting.Location}. With a swift motion, {Actor2.Name}, a {Actor2.Occupation} who {Actor2.Description}, threw {Actor2.Pronoun2} fist at {Actor1.Name}'s face. However, {Actor1.Name} was able to convert it to a handshake, thus making them friends!|Happy
It was incredibly an {Setting.Weather} day, and {Actor1.Name} HATED it. {Actor1.Name} {Actor1.Description}, and their associate {Actor2.Name}, who {Actor2.Description}, were sitting in the middle of a {Setting.Location}. Thinking of a way to pass the time (that didn't involve doing their jobs as a {Actor1.Occupation} and a {Actor2.Occupation}) until the weather improved, they played a riviting game of cards. Yet, before {Actor1.Pronoun1} knew it, the weather had improved, and they were able to enjoy the day.|Happy
{Actor1.Name} and {Actor2.Name} were competing head-to-head in a hotdog eating competition. The mighty {Actor1.Occupation} {Actor1.Name} {Actor1.Description} and the strong-willed {Actor2.Occupation} {Actor2.Name} {Actor2.Description}, but none of that matters now in this {Setting.Weather} {Setting.Location}. After what felt like hours, the competition came to an end. However... too late they realized it was actually a hamburger eating competition... and they both tied for last place.|Tragic
{Actor1.Name} {Actor1.Description}... but more importantly {Actor1.Pronoun1} is EVIL! And also a {Actor1.Occupation}. {Actor2.Name}, who {Actor2.Description} and works as a {Actor2.Occupation}, tried to stop {Actor1.Pronoun2} from adding an 'f' to RIT's Preforming Arts Center. However the world blew up and everyone died. Also I was in the {Setting.Location} on this {Setting.Weather} day when it happened.|Tragic
{Actor1.Name}, who {Actor1.Description}, was incredbily excited. A new movie just came out, and they were super excited to watch it with {Actor2.Name}, who {Actor2.Description}, after they got done with their {Actor2.Occupation} work for the day. {Actor1.Name}, a {Actor1.Occupation}, clocked out hours ago. Finally on this {Setting.Weather} day, {Actor1.Name} and {Actor2.Name} got to the {Setting.Location} - the ONLY place the movie was being shown... but the seats were full!!|Twist
God was angry. Gathering all of His strength, he sent lightning bolts down to kill {Actor1.Name}, a {Actor1.Occupation} who {Actor1.Description} and {Actor2.Name}, a {Actor2.Occupation} who {Actor2.Description}. Flying through the {Setting.Weather} atmosphere, the bolts arrived at the {Setting.Location} where the two were. Then, the lightning hit. Yet... the two were unharmed... and pissed off.|Twist
WHAT, exclaimed {Actor1.Name}. They're all gone, screamed {Actor2.Name}. {Actor1.Name} was a {Actor1.Occupation} and {Actor2.Name} was a {Actor2.Occupation}, but that doesn't mean they weren't prepared to see all of the nuclear launch codes missing. Thus, on this {Setting.Weather} night, {Actor1.Name} {Actor1.Description}, {Actor2.Name} {Actor2.Description} were responsible for giving the codes to the evil Dr. Fart, and soon enough they rushed over to his secret base at the world's last remaining {Setting.Location}.|Cliffhanger
Rock climbing sure is fun, said {Actor1.Name}, a {Actor1.Occupation} who {Actor1.Description}. You said it, said {Actor1.Name}, a {Actor1.Occupation} who {Actor1.Description}. They stared at the setting sun, putting a close to the beautiful {Setting.Weather} day. Do you wanna go hang off of that cliff and watch the sunset, said {Actor2.Name}. {Actor1.Name} agreed, and they watched it set far past the {Setting.Location} they started at.|Cliffhanger
Despite the {Setting.Weather} day, {Actor1.Name} was looking forward to seeing the light show at the {Setting.Location}, avoiding his job as a {Actor1.Occupation}. {Actor1.Pronoun} {Actor1.Description}, and their best friend, {Actor2.Name}, who {Actor2.Description} and works as a {Actor2.Occupation}, had their tickets ready to go! However, when they arrived, there was only one person there... who's name was light show!! They looked at him... he was ok.|Strange
{Actor1.Name}, who {Actor1.Description} and was a {Actor1.Occupation}, died. Everyone believed that {Actor1.Pronoun1} died from a heart attack... but only {Actor2.Name}, a lonely {Actor2.Occupation}, knew the truth. {Actor2.Pronoun1} {Actor2.Description}, but more importantly, {Actor2.Pronoun1} knew that {Actor1.Name} was an alien! Thus, when they were both at a {Setting.Weather} {Setting.Location}, {Actor2.Name} poisoned {Actor1.Name} and saved the world! But nobody ever knew...|Strange
{Actor1.Name} existed. {Actor1.Pronoun1} {Actor1.Description} or something. {Actor2.Name} also existed. {Actor2.Pronoun1} {Actor2.Description} or something. {Actor1.Name} was a {Actor1.Occupation} and {Actor2.Name} was a {Actor2.Occupation}. When they saw each other at a {Setting.Weather} {Setting.Location}, they said "hi" and walked past each other. The end.|Lame
{Actor1.Name} and {Actor2.Name} were walking, finally having a break from their jobs as a {Actor1.Occupation} and a {Actor2.Occupation} respectively. {Actor1.Name} {Actor1.Description}, and {Actor2.Name} {Actor2.Description}. They considered going into the dangerous, spine-tingling, {Setting.Weather} {Setting.Location} where the secret golden artifact was stored... but they decided to go to the library instead. Nerds.|Lame
